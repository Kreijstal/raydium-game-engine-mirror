// Introduction
/**
Raydium provides camera management functions, allowing the coder to
move camera with very simple functions, even for complex moves.
You have to place your camera once per frame (not more, not less).

"look_at" style functions can be affected by ##raydium_camera_look_at_roll##
global variable, if needed.

A few words about camera path: Take a look to a .cam file if you want to
understand this simple file format, but you probably only need the ##cam.c##
application, dedicated to camera path creation.

Some camera functions are provided by physics module, see suitable chapter.

extern void raydium_camera_vectors (GLfloat * res3);
/**
This function will return two vectors (2 * 3 * GLfloat), giving the camera 
orientation (front vector and up vector). At this day, the up vector is 
always the same as the world up vector, even if the camera is rotated 
or upside down (and yes, this MUST be corrected :).

Designed for internal uses, before all.

/**
Sets the camera at (x,y,z) position, and using (lacet,tangage,roulis) 
as rotation angles.
**/

extern void raydium_camera_look_at (GLfloat x, GLfloat y, GLfloat z, GLfloat x_to, GLfloat y_to, GLfloat z_to);

extern void raydium_camera_replace (void);
/**
You'll need to reset camera position and orientation after each object drawing.
If this is unclear to you, read the "example" section, below.

You will need to make your own 3D transformations (GLRotate, GLTranslate, 
...) to draw your objects, or you can use the following function.
**/

This function will replace the camera, as ##raydium_camera_replace()##,
but will place "3D drawing cursor" at position ##pos## (3 GLfloat) with 
rotation ##R## (4 GLfloat quaternion).

No eulers (rotx, roty, rotz) version of this function is provided for now.. 
Do you really need it ?
**/

// Example of camera use
/**
1. place camera
2. move "drawing cursor" to object's place
3. draw object
4. reset camera to initial place (the one given at step 1)
5. move "drawing cursor" to another object's place
6. draw another object
7. [...]

Steps 4 and 5 can be done with raydium_camera_replace_go().

Camera (any type) will rumble for ##secs## seconds, with ##amplitude## (radians).

values are allowed).
An ##amplitude## is always positive.

Smooth style clone of ##raydium_camera_look_at##.
Roll is given by ##roll## and not global variable ##raydium_camera_look_at_roll##
as for regular look_at function.
##zoom## is the requested FOV.
Play with step to modify smoothing level of the movement. A good way to use
this function is the following usage :
%%(c) raydium_camera_smooth(cam[0],cam[1],cam[2],pos[1],-pos[2],pos[0],70,0,raydium_frame_time*3); %%
