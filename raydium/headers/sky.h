// Introduction
/**
Skyboxes are mostly automated.

For now, Raydium will use ##BOXfront.tga##, ##BOXback.tga##, ##BOXleft.tga##,
##BOXright.tga##, ##BOXbottom.tga## and ##BOXtop.tga## and will draw a 
skybox only if fog is disabled (this is not for technical reasons, 
but only for realism, just think about it ;)... but you can force 
skybox with fog using ##raydium_sky_force## if you really want).
**/

/**
As skybox texture are sometimes large files, you can pre-load skybox
with this function. If you don't do it, Raydium will load textures 
during the first frame of your application.
Calling this function will automatically define sky as a HDR emitter.
See HDR chapter for more information.

__rayapi void raydium_sky_sphere_render(GLfloat x, GLfloat y, GLfloat z, int detail);

Calculates and draw the sphere. Also rotate it according the angles or orbit.

//Atmosphere
/**
Atmosphere are series of effects that intend to make the sky and the atmosphere
of the game more realistic. As this is quite-beta state, only a orbital sky 
effect is available right now. 
To activate/deactivate this series of effects, you should use:
##raydium_sky_atmosphere_enable## and ##raydium_sky_atmosphere_disable## 
respectively.
If you need to check if the atmosphere is activated or not, use 
##raydium_sky_atmosphere_check##. The rest of the functions are internal 
and should not used by normal programs.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_sky_atmosphere_enable(void);
/**
turn on the use of atmosphere effects.
This one and _disable function a program should use, the other 
##raydium_sky_atmosphere_## are internal ones.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_sky_atmosphere_disable(void);
/**
turn off the use of atmosphere effects.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_sky_atmosphere_render(GLfloat x, GLfloat y, GLfloat z,int detail);
/**
Internal use. This internal function draws the atmosphere effects. Right 
now only draws a rotating sphere with a gradient of color (from black to white).
In a future, it will draw multiples layers of sky (with and without textures),
stars, satellites... Maybe rain and snow could be included here also.
**/

__rayapi signed char raydium_sky_atmosphere_check(void);
/**
This functions only check if the atmosphere features are been used. 
Returns 1 if they are used, else 0.
**/

__rayapi void raydium_sky_box_set_texture_prefix(char *prefix, char *ext);
/**
This function allows to load custom name sky textures. 
By default the names of the sky texture are: 
BOXfront.tga
BOXback.tga
BOXleft.tga
BOXright.tga
BOXbottom.tga
BOXtop.tga
However with this function you can define a prefix name and an extension
to apply for each texture. So the final names would remain as:
<prefix>front.<ext>
<prefix>back.<ext>
<prefix>left.<ext>
<prefix>right.<ext>
<prefix>bottom.<ext>
<prefix>top.<ext>

This function should be called before that raydium_sky_box_cache().
