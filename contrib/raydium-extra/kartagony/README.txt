Kartagony is a small unreleased, unfinished, multiplayer game, where players 
drivers small karts and use bonus to kill each others (Team Deathmatch).

The "main" file is kartagony.c (and will include all others).

The game *should* (not tested since a long time) work with the regular
generic Raydium server (tests.c).

All data *should* be available on official repository, too.
